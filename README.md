# KCC

**Kindle Comic Converter** is a Python app to convert comic files or folders to ePub or Panel View MOBI.
It was initally developed for Kindle but since v2.2 it outputs valid ePub 2.0 so _**despite its name, KCC is
actually a comic to EPUB converter that every e-reader owner can happily use**_.
It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.

### A word of warning
**KCC** _is not_ [Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001103761) nor is in any way endorsed by Amazon.  
Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while **KCC** is for comic readers.
_KC2_ in no way is a replacement for **KCC** so you can be quite confident we'll going to carry on developing our little monster ;-)
