# Changelog
#  1.00 - Initial version
#  1.10 - Added support for CBZ/CBR files
#  1.11 - Added support for ZIP/RAR extensions
#  1.20 - Comic optimizations! Split pages not target-oriented (landscape
#       with portrait target or portrait with landscape target), add palette
#       and other image optimizations from Mangle.
#       WARNING: PIL is required for all image mangling!
#
# Todo:
#   - Add gracefully exit for CBR if no rarfile.py and no unrar
#       executable are found
#   - Improve error reporting
#   - recurse into dirtree for multiple comics
